# Code of Conduct
aka "Dynamics of Working as a Team"

## Chiefs Everywhere

There is no boss-employee dynamic. Everyone on the team is a chief.

This is to nurture an environment of empowering everyone to express their ideas and creativity, but more importantly so the absence of a singular leader doesn't cause the entire project to come to a screeching halt. If everyone knows the general direction of the project, and what needs to be done at all levels, then anyone on the team has power to keep it moving forward without asking for too much direction. We should still have open communication so we coordinate ourselves.

Skill diversity is healthy for a team. It's good to have a beginner, a few intermediates, and an advanced person. For example, in a typical 5-person team: 1 beginner, 3 intermediate, 1 advanced/experienced. The beginner can learn from the advanced, and the advanced can learn leadership skills/project management/refresh their own beginner skills.

## High-Five Your Coworkers

It's easy to be so involved in details of the project that we neglect basic mental health. Remember to take breaks...

* take real physical walks around your block (not just surf the web).

* Listen to a favorite song (and sing along... loudly).

* Drink cold water.

* Breathe fresh air at a park.

Once in a while, compliment your teammates... that can mean a lot when someone has been grinding all day, and be genuine about it. Do 10 jumping jacks every 2-3 hours as an alternative to drinking caffeine. Get good sleep (on time and 6-8 hours).

Personality types. As you've noticed...

...humans have dynamic personalities and moods can change by the hour and depending on circumstance. Be mindful of how you express your thoughts, if you can. You never know who is struggling with personal life issues.

Allow people to express themselves as they want, but politely offer them advice if you think they're going off the rails. Be patient with frustrated beginners, offer them a better frame of mind to understand things, use analogies/metaphors, and link them to resources so they teach themselves.

Be grateful of advice from the more experienced but question whatever seems of interest to you. Clarify misunderstandings with direct questions instead of making assumptions or staying quiet only to go in the wrong direction because you didn't speak up. Some teammates can't handle pressure, be kinder to them. Others need constant praise and approval to feel they're doing well, give them praise. Others have a high need to be a director and need little praise or even guidance, just give them more goals to accomplish. Some are more formal while others are playful.

Find your own best way to adapt, have open communication with someone you trust. Sometimes we need to change our personality a tiny bit to accomodate others', while other times its perfectly fine to remain exactly who you are. No hard rules. Do what you can. Life is crazy. It's a miracle we're even a team, ha!

## Rambling Rambo

It's okay to ramble your inner thoughts out loud with your teammates, especially on Discord (that's what it's for).

It's probably the coffee, anyway! ☕

Enjoy the "buzz" of coding. Speak your mind with your teammates so they know you better and where you're coming from with your ideas. Or be a quiet introvert — that's ok, too.
